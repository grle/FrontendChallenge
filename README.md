This is a prototype for an app I created called "BusyBus," which allows users to
find public transportation at their location. The app informs users what buses
are arriving at their station, and how often it comes to that they can prepare 
for its arrival. It also informs users what buses are being delayed, and which
buses are currently out of service.
